Hi. I'm Wen HaiWen.

I'm a software engineer who values lightweight agile processes, TDD, and good design. But above all: shipping.

I live and work in Xiamen. I went to school at [NCIAE University](http://www.nciae.edu.cn/). I do a little bit of everything, but Iâ€™m happiest working with Golang, Python or JavaScript. I come at problems with an Engineer's Mindset and am always striving to write clean, readable code.

## Skills

- Golang, Python, JavaScript, Java, HTML5, CSS3
- Gin, Flask, Tornado, Django, Vue.js, Bootstrap, Angular
- Webpack, Gulp
- Android
- Mysql, Mongodb, Redis
- Linux, Docker, Vim, Git
